# PyRunnerX.ExampleUsage

Debug through code to see example showing setup of a WorkerService which uses the PyRunnerX project.

Note: To debug through the actual Python script (launched and run in a seperate process) it is necessary to enable mixed-mode debugging [Tutorial: Debug C# and C++ in the same debugging session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2017/debugger/how-to-debug-managed-and-native-code?view=vs-2017#to-configure-mixed-mode-debugging-for-a-net-core-app) and add the extension [Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool2022) (a simialr tool is also available for VS 2019).
